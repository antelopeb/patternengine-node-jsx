# patternengine-node-jsx
This is an experimental pattern engine for use with Patternlab and React.js / JSX based components. The engine right now handles React components build with the class methodology, and compiles through Babel to usable code. It outputs the HTML into the Patternlab, but isn't creating usable JS components in the browser yet.
